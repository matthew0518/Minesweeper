# Minesweeper Game

A classic Minesweeper game implemented in C++ using the Qt framework. The game features a 16x30 grid with 99 mines, interactive buttons, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for an engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Grid Layout**: 16 rows x 30 columns with 99 randomly placed mines.
- **Interactive GUI**: Left-click to reveal cells, right-click to flag or mark cells with a question mark.
- **Win/Lose Conditions**: Pop-up dialogs notify the player when they win or lose.
- **Recursive Reveal**: Automatically reveals adjacent cells when a cell with no neighboring mines is clicked.

## Prerequisites
- **Qt Framework**: Ensure you have Qt installed on your system.
- **qmake6**: Used to generate the Makefile.
- **make**: Used to build the project
- **C++ Compiler**: A compatible C++ compiler (`g++`).
